# Honeycomb

Honeycomb is an experimental framework for autonomous log analysis, designed to explore prompt chaining and reasoning in real-world security use cases. Built entirely on **Anthropic's APIs**, Honeycomb focuses on providing transparency and control without relying on external abstractions like LangChain.

## ðŸš§ Work-in-Progress ðŸš§

Honeycomb is an evolving experiment in applying advanced prompt chaining techniques, including chain-of-density prompting, to honeypot log analysis. Current focus areas include:
- Chunking large logs into manageable pieces for reliable processing
- Refining prompt structures to maximize the quality and relevance of responses
- Building autonomous analysis chains for statistical metrics, pattern detection, and threat intelligence
- Implementing chain-of-density principles for progressive insight generation

## Key Features

- **Chain-of-Density Implementation**: Uses a modified version of Anthropic's chain-of-density prompting technique, adapted for security analysis instead of content generation
- **Progressive Analysis Chains**: Each chain builds upon previous chains' outputs, creating increasingly sophisticated insights
- **Log Chunking**: Breaks down large datasets into smaller, manageable pieces to improve processing accuracy
- **Statistical Metrics**: Extracts raw statistics (e.g., request counts, IP distributions) without interpretation
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies routine and anomalous scanning activity using predefined prompts
- **End-to-End Control**: Built solely with Anthropic's APIs, ensuring all functionality is explicit and customizable

## Why Honeycomb?

Unlike frameworks that abstract complexity (e.g., LangChain), Honeycomb is built to expose the mechanics of prompt chaining. This makes it an excellent platform for:
- Experimenting with autonomous reasoning in security contexts
- Understanding the limits and strengths of Anthropic's APIs in practical applications
- Building a foundation for more advanced AI-driven analysis workflows
- Exploring novel applications of chain-of-density prompting in analytical tasks

## Chain-of-Density Architecture

Honeycomb adapts the chain-of-density prompting technique, originally designed for content generation, into a security analysis framework:

1. **Base Layer - Metrics Collection (Chain 1)**:
   - Focuses on pure data extraction
   - Generates structured statistical measurements
   - Creates foundation for further analysis

2. **Pattern Recognition Layer (Chain 2)**:
   - Takes metrics from Chain 1
   - Identifies routine patterns and known behaviors
   - Groups related activities for context

3. **Anomaly Analysis Layer (Chain 3)**:
   - Uses output from previous chains
   - Identifies deviations from routine patterns
   - Focuses on novel or interesting behaviors

4. **Aggregation Layer (Chain 5)**:
   - Combines metrics across all chunks
   - Consolidates statistical insights

5. **Pattern Consolidation Layer (Chain 6)**:
   - Deduplicates and merges routine patterns
   - Creates unified view of activities

6. **Summary Layer (Chain 4)**:
   - Synthesizes all previous chain outputs
   - Produces human-readable insights
   - Maintains information density while ensuring clarity

## Current Status

### Implemented:
1. **Log Chunking**: Divides large log files for better handling and processing
2. **Chain-of-Density Prompt Chains**:
   - Base metrics collection (Chain 1)
   - Pattern recognition (Chain 2)
   - Anomaly detection (Chain 3)
   - Metric aggregation (Chain 5)
   - Pattern deduplication (Chain 6)
   - Summary generation (Chain 4)

### In Progress:
- Enhancing chunking logic for large and diverse datasets
- Adding contextual correlation in pattern detection
- Testing outputs with real-world honeypot data
- Fine-tuning prompt designs for better chain integration
- Optimizing chain-of-density implementation for security analysis

     * Analysis quality assessment
     * Pattern context preservation
     * Temporal relationship maintenance
   - Create test datasets with known patterns
   - Build automated chunk size evaluation tools

2. **Chain Enhancement**:
   - Add feedback loops between chains
   - Implement cross-chunk pattern correlation
   - Develop chain-specific performance metrics
   - Create chain output validation mechanisms

3. **Analysis Improvements**:
   - Enhanced temporal pattern detection
   - Geographic attack pattern correlation
   - Payload similarity analysis
   - Attack campaign identification

   - Add support for distributed processing
   - Create visualization components
   - Develop real-time analysis capabilities
   - Add export formats for popular SIEM systems

5. **Documentation and Testing**:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Add unit tests for each chain
   - Develop integration test suite
   - Write detailed deployment guides
   - Create example analysis notebooks
